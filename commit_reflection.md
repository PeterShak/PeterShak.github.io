Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
  Yes. I made commits after a place that woudl make the most sense as to not have too many commits in rapid succession. 
How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
  Very well. They are very clear, direct, and address what was done at each commit. 
How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
  I'm going to clearly label every action that I do so I can go back and reflect on how well I did and/or how I can improve.
