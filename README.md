* Peter Shaknes (He/Him)
* I took coding in 7th grade, however, it was the year COVID happened and it was 5 years ago, so I forgot a lot. I coded in HTML, JAVAScript, and CSS as well as a little bit in Python.
* I am hopefully taking criminology in college next year. One of the classes you take is computer science, so I want to get a leg up on people. Also, I have wanted to learn how to code for a while now (I watched Michael Reeves and the coding was interesting to me)
* I was in the UK for the whole summer and missed the sandwhich that I get with my friend at the deli near my house, so that would have to be teh best thing I ate this summer

Fun facts about me:
* I have a dog 
* My fovorite drink is tea
